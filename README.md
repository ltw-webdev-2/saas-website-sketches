# SaaS website sketches

## Overview

Mark up your wireframes with important parts of what you’ll need to code. Similar to what we did in the [Sketching websites](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/courses/web-dev-2/sketching-websites/) & [Finding patterns](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/courses/web-dev-2/finding-patterns/) exercises.

Sketch out the following items:

- The important semantics: `<h1>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, etc.
- Grid rows and columns & the unit sizes for different screen widths
- Type system classes: `.island`, `.push`, `.pad`, etc.
- Module classes: `.list-group`, `.embed`, `.btn`, etc.
